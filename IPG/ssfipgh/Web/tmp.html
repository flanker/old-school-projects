<p>As you can see, we are creating a JsonResult object at the beginning of the method.
    JsonResult is a simple class which has only two properties: isSuccessful and errorMessage,
    which denotes if the controller action was successful. If the operation is not successful,
    it populates the errorMessage with the proper reason. In the end, we are passing
    the result as view data of the shared view called "Json". Since this is a shared
    view and it will be used by both UserController and StoryController, we have placed
    it in the Shared folder under the Views. I am excluding the other methods of this
    controller as they work almost the same as this. One important thing I would like
    to mention is that instead of using the static Membership class directly in the
    code, we are passing the abstract membership provider in the constructor of this
    controller. The reason behind this is that we can pass a Mock Membership Provider
    in our Unit Test, which we will check next. And in the other constructor, we are
    passing the default membership provider, which is configured in the web.config.

<p>In this part, we took a brief overview of the ASP.NET MVC Framework and learned how
    to assign functionality to controllers, how to define the routing rules and test
    them against URLs. We have also seen how to create a Controller that returns JSON
    data instead of regular HTML, and tested the controller. In the next part, we will
    talk more about the Controller, which renders regular HTML view, using master pages
    and user controls to create the view, passing strongly typed view data to the view
    and finally creating the Model. Stay tuned. </p>

<h1>Global Market Entry Partnership</h1>
<hr />
<p>For over 20 years, western companies have sought to produce goods in China leveraging on its abundant and cheap labor resources; China has served mostly as a manufacturing platform for them. As China’s domestic market continues to mature and the Western economies in crisis, the need to enter China is ever greater. Although most of Global 500 companies have already established a presence in China, most small and medium size companies in the western economies have yet to enter the Chinese market. Unlike the “big boys”, small and medium size companies have much less cash and human resources to make an extravagant entry into a vast and complex Chinese market; the risk of failure is high. </p>
<p>Traditional entry service providers are mostly US or EU based outsourcing companies or well-known consulting firms such as McKinsey, BCG, and Bain; they operate based on consulting fees which has three key disadvantages: (1) their incentives are not directly aligned with the client; (2) their return is only derived from human capital; (3) their high fees are prohibitive for SMEs, and especially for start-up firms with high-potential technology which are often strained on cash.  What do SMEs and especially early stage high potential ventures need is often not paying a team of consultants for a large report on how to enter the Chinese market, but a partner firm in China which not only advises them on market entry, but also incubates them and provides financial solutions to them. </p>
<h2>The IPG Model for Market Entry Partnership</h2>
<ul> 
	<li> In addition to offering market entry consulting and advisory service , IPG offers to directly participate in the execution of market entry projects either by acting as a representative or as a business partner. For certain projects, IPG will only act as a consultancy, but its main focus is to identify high-potential ventures and help them enter the Chinese market such as establishing a Chinese subsidiary or a joint-venture with a Chinese domestic company.  From this perspective, IPG is very entrepreneurial. In the subsidiary case, IPG would take an equity stake in the client’s Chinese company rather than billing for fees. In the joint-venture case, IPG will propose a profit sharing plan. In essence, IPG uses a partnership model rather than a consulting model. </li>
	<li>On the operation side, IPG considers high-potential clients as portfolio companies much like what a venture capital does. It also provides financial services to its clients such as identifying and syndicating investors, organizing PE investment, and/or help the client go public in the China. In the near future, IPG plans to have its own venture fund to make investments in selected companies. </li>

<h2>Competitive Advantages</h2>
<ul> 
	<li>IPG’s Global Market Entry Partnership uses an equity and profit sharing based model rather than fee based. There is little up-front costs to clients. If IPG does not do a best job or provide the most accurate advice, it would not make any profit. As a result, IPG’s interests are almost perfectly aligned with its clients.</li>
	<li>IPG is not a technology firm and do not wish to steal the partner’s IP or manage partner’s firm for forever. Partner firms will gain control of their Chinese company once it’s operating smoothly. </li>
	<li>Most IPG people are Chinese expatriates with extensive experience in both China and aboard. They are better communicators who understand both east and west. IPG people are young, passionate, ethical, and flexible. </li>
	<li>China is arguably the most promising market going forward.</li>

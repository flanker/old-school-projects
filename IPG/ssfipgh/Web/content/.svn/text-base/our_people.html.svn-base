<h1>Our People</h1>
<hr />
<p>IPG employs individuals with the highest professional credentials, all of which are either Chinese or connected to China in a major way. Most IPG people have experience working for leading companies or financial institutions in the world including the Boeing Company, BASF, adidas, McKinsey and Company, Morgan Stanley, HSBC, Credit Swiss, Bank of China, and Oriental Patron Financial Group (HK). Almost all of IPG team members attended top universities such as Harvard, Oxford, London School of Economics, Peking University, University of California, and top business schools in Europe and USA. Additionally, IPG holds its team members to the highest ethical standards. They are entrepreneurial, passionate, and well connected in business and government decision centers in China, the United States and globally. The truly unique thing about IPG people is that they are “polymaths” – people whose expertise covers a significant number of subject areas.

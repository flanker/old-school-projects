<h2>Founder's Message</h2>
<p>
It is our belief that IPG is not made like any of those (companies) we’ve seen; it is not made like any of those who are in existence; if IPG is not better, at least it is different. This belief in IPG is not founded on over confidence, but on the humble belief of forever learning, improving, and innovating. We do not claim to have a better solution for the world’s problems, but a right starting point and the will to get there. Our core values are not about winning or losing, but to help others realize their dreams, which, within IPG, also helps us realize our dreams. We do not just want to have greater financial returns, but to create positive impacts, to teach others, and to leave a legacy for the world. That is why we named ourselves Infinite Positive Group.</p>

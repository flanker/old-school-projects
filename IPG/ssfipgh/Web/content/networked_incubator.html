<h1>IPG Networked Venture Incubator</h1>
<hr />
<p>IPG Networked Venture Incubator is an envisioned early stage incubator and venture capital especially designed for the Chinese market. Currently, there are little seed and early stage venture capital investments in China. This is partially due to a lack of credibility in the society and partly due to higher idiosyncratic risks of early stage investments in China. The networked Venture Incubator is uniquely designed to obtain small percentage equity stakes in start-up companies without actually investing money in them. The incubator would then monitor and evaluate portfolio firms over a period of time, and make investments in a selected few.  Using a special arrangement, this incubator would be able avoid the situation where the entrepreneur runs way with the money, which happens quite often in China.  Eventually, IPG would provide a variety of services to its portfolio companies  such as its management solutions, strategy consulting, and investment banking services.</p>

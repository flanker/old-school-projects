<h1>IPG Business Model</h1>
<hr />
<p>IPG is an envisioned next generation Venture Incubator, Think Center, and Conglomerate Company.  It is designed based on IPG's own management theory, research on current business models, and findings from economics, mathematics, biology, philosophy, and computer science.
</p>
<p>
On a macro level, IPG contains two different yet interconnected groups, Infinite Group Ventures (IGV) and Positive Think Center (PTC). IGV is a group of networked high potential ventures. PTC is group of synergetic service companies. The two groups are connected in a unique way that helps each other to grow and perform better. Unlike the age old pyramid organizational structure, IPG has a "double strand" structure and a "light bulb" corporate system:</p>
<ul> The power of IPG lies in
	<li class="narrow">Its ability to constantly create new ideas and develop new businesses</li>
	<li class="narrow">Its businesses are themselves a testing lab for self-generated innovations</li>
	<li class="narrow">Its networked structure and unconstrained business ambition</li>
	<li class="narrow">Its exchange system for idea and people both inside groups and across groups</li>
	<li class="narrow">Its venture capital like relationship between IPG, IPG ventures, and IPG people</li>
	<li class="narrow">Its people: they are passionate, entrepreneurial, polymath, and visionary</li>
</ul>
<p>
In its vision, IPG is a dynamic self-organizing and self-adoptive complex system. It has no defined business area or the number of businesses it must have. It is a platform organization which allows IPG people to pursue many different opportunities and enable highly positive returns.  IPG's  ultimate business model is the soul of the company. It is the Group's long-term objective and will be realized in different stages. IPG Global Market Entry Partnership marks the beginning of a first step toward realizing IPG stage one business objectives.
